# ClosePlan Development Process Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the step-by-step process for building features in ClosePlan using Cursor AI. It's designed to maintain consistency and quality throughout development.

## Feature Development Lifecycle

### 1. Planning Phase
- Review relevant sections in user-requirements.md
- Review technical-requirements.md for constraints
- Break down feature into smaller components
- Create mockups if needed (store in docs/assets/mockups)
- Document any new requirements discovered

#### Planning Checklist
- [ ] Requirements reviewed and understood
- [ ] Components identified
- [ ] User flows documented
- [ ] Technical constraints noted
- [ ] Mockups created (if needed)

### 2. Development Environment Setup
- Ensure you're in the correct branch
- Update local dependencies
- Review relevant prompts in prompts/feature-prompts/
- Set up any necessary testing data

#### Setup Checklist
- [ ] Branch created from main
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] Development environment working
- [ ] Access to necessary APIs/services

### 3. Building with Cursor AI

#### Starting a New Feature
1. Create a new prompt file in prompts/feature-prompts/
2. Include:
   - Feature requirements
   - Technical constraints
   - Examples of similar features
   - Links to relevant documentation

#### Working with Cursor AI
- Use clear, specific prompts
- Reference existing code and documentation
- Build incrementally, testing each piece
- Document any unexpected behaviors or limitations

#### Best Practices
- Keep prompts focused on one task at a time
- Use the analysis tool for complex calculations
- Create reusable components where possible
- Document AI decisions and alternatives considered

### 4. Testing Process

#### Component Testing
1. Test each component in isolation
2. Verify all user interactions work
3. Check error handling
4. Test edge cases
5. Document any limitations

#### Integration Testing
1. Test component interactions
2. Verify data flow
3. Check performance
4. Test with different user roles
5. Validate against requirements

#### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Component tests passed
- [ ] Integration tests passed
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Security requirements met
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met

### 5. Documentation

#### Code Documentation
- Add clear comments explaining complex logic
- Document any assumptions made
- Include usage examples
- Note any dependencies

#### User Documentation
- Update relevant user guides
- Add screenshots if needed
- Document new features
- Include any known limitations

#### Documentation Checklist
- [ ] Code comments added
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] User documentation updated
- [ ] Release notes prepared

### 6. Review Process

#### Self-Review
- Code meets style guidelines
- Documentation is complete
- Tests are passing
- Performance is acceptable
- Security considerations addressed

#### Peer Review
- Share code for review
- Address feedback
- Document major decisions
- Update documentation based on feedback

## Working with Components

### Component Creation Process
1. Plan component structure
2. Create basic implementation
3. Add styling
4. Implement interactions
5. Add error handling
6. Document usage

### Component Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow accessibility guidelines
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Document props and usage
- Include error boundaries

## Common Patterns

### State Management
- Use React hooks appropriately
- Document state structures
- Consider performance implications
- Handle loading and error states

### Data Handling
- Validate input data
- Handle loading states
- Implement error handling
- Cache data when appropriate
- Document data structures

### UI/UX Patterns
- Follow design system guidelines
- Maintain consistent spacing
- Use appropriate feedback mechanisms
- Consider mobile responsiveness
- Test with different screen sizes

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. Performance Problems
   - Check component re-renders
   - Review data structure efficiency
   - Monitor network requests
   - Profile component performance

2. State Management Issues
   - Review state updates
   - Check for race conditions
   - Verify cleanup functions
   - Monitor memory usage

3. UI Inconsistencies
   - Check responsive breakpoints
   - Verify style inheritance
   - Test different browsers
   - Validate accessibility

### Debug Process
1. Identify the problem
2. Reproduce consistently
3. Isolate the cause
4. Implement fix
5. Verify solution
6. Document resolution

## Release Process

### Pre-Release Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance verified
- [ ] Security reviewed
- [ ] Accessibility confirmed
- [ ] Browser testing complete

### Release Steps
1. Merge to staging
2. Run final tests
3. Update documentation
4. Create release notes
5. Deploy to production
6. Monitor for issues

## Maintenance
