# Role-Based Access - User Stories

*   As a vendor sales rep, I want to be able to log in with my company credentials so that I can access my assigned deals.
*   As a customer procurement officer, I want to be able to access the platform with a unique login so that I can see the status of our deal and collaborate with the vendor.
*   As a vendor sales manager, I want to be able to see all deals for my team, but not deals managed by other teams.
*   As a system administrator, I want to be able to manage user accounts and roles so that I can control access to the platform.
*   As a customer, I do not want to see internal vendor notes.
