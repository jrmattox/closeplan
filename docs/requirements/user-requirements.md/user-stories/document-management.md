*   As a customer contact, I want to be able to download documents shared by the vendor so that I can review them.
*   As a sales rep, I want to be able to see a history of document versions so that I can track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.
*    As a legal team member, I only want to see documents that are relevant to me.
*   As a sales manager, I want to be able to control access to documents based on user roles so that sensitive information is protected.
*   As a sales rep, I want to be able to organize documents into folders.
