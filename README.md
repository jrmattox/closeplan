# ClosePlan

## Overview
ClosePlan is a specialized B2B sales deal management application designed to streamline complex, multi-stakeholder sales processes. Initially focused on companies selling to health systems, the platform provides a secure, collaborative environment where both vendors (sellers) and customers (buyers) can access and manage deal-related information. By organizing critical stakeholders, tracking customized workstreams, and managing deal artifacts, ClosePlan addresses the unique challenges of healthcare sales. With integrations such as Definitive Healthcare to enrich organizational insights, the platform ensures compliance, transparency, and efficient communication. Its modular, extensible architecture also sets the stage for future expansion into other verticals, allowing the technology to evolve alongside your business needs
